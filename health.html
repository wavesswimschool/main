									</header>

									<h2>Aim</h2>
									<p>The aim of this policy is to prevent accidents and occupational ill health by eliminating hazards, wherever possible, and by reducing those that remain to the lowest level reasonably practicable.</p>
									<p>The Health and Safety Policy demonstrates that all members of the Swimming School have a part to play in making our workplace safe and healthy.</p>

                                    <h2>GENERAL POLICY</h2>
									<p>Waves Swimming School will, so far as reasonably practicable, take all steps necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all its teachers, lifeguards and other persons in the pool area and will endeavour to conduct its affairs in such a way as to protect persons not in their employment who may be affected by its undertaking.</p>

									<h4>Particular attention will be paid to the provision of:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Safe systems of work.</li>
											<li>Arrangements for the safe use, handling and storage of equipment.</li>
											<li>Sufficient information, instruction, training and supervision to enable all affected people to contribute to their own health and safety and to avoid hazards.</li>
                                            <li>A safe place to work with safe access and egress from it.</li>
											<li>Training for employees in first aid, life-saving and resuscitation.</li>
											<li>The water should be tested at the specified time as arranged with qualified staff and no pupils should enter the water if the water quality is below standard.</li>
                                            <li>The awareness of the drugs and alcohol misuse</li>
											<li>Risk/hazard assessments for each pool.</li>
										</ul>

<p>Arrangements for the reporting of injuries and dangerous occurrences will be in accordance with RIDDOR 1995.</p>

                                    <h2>LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
									<p>Employer: Responsible for health, safety and safe working practices within the working environment, promoting best practice and ensuring that a safe system of work is employed.</p>
                                    <p>Employee: While at work to take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves, their pupils and other persons who may be affected by their acts or omissions.</p>

                                    <h2>STRATEGY FOR MANAGING CHILDRENS’ BEHAVIOUR</h2>
									<p>Waves Swimming School  accepts that, in extreme cases, physical action may be necessary to take a child away from a situation so as to stop personal injury either to the child, to other children, to an adult or to prevent damage to property.</p>
                                    Should a child misbehave repeatedly the Teacher will explain why their behaviour is not acceptable and that if the pupil persists with this behaviour they will be taken away from the situation. This could mean sitting on the pool wall or poolside chair for a ’time out’. The pupil should be observed during this time in case there is any over-reaction. After the ‘time out’ period the child should be returned to the lesson and encouraged to do well so that any effort to conform may be rewarded by verbal praises. The teacher needs to reinforce signs of good, acceptable behaviour. No child should leave the pool or go home on a negative note and without the Teacher speaking to them positively.

                                    <p>If a child continues to be constantly disruptive the Teacher will speak to the parent asking for their support. The Teacher must also inform a partner, who will follow up the matter as soon as possible. After further consultation with the Teacher, various strategies may be used to help the child.  In the unlikely event of poor behaviour continuing the child MAY be asked to leave the Swimming School.</p>
                                    <p>Frequent poor behaviour may suggest an underlying problem that needs investigation. It is important that this is followed up.</p>
