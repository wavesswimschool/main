										<h1>Equality and Diversity</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Waves’ Swimming School is committed to treating everyone equally regardless of their age, level of ability or disability, gender, marital or civil partnership status, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or belief, sexual orientation or any other relevant characteristic.</p>
									<p>The Swim School will ensure that equality is incorporated in all aspects of its activities and also recognises and adopts the principles of Sport England and the Swim England Equality & Diversity policy. (www.swimming.org/swimengland).</p>
									<p>Teachers at Waves have a responsibility not only to behave equitably themselves but they must also play an important role in promoting equitable behaviour among other participants of the lessons and in selecting appropriate ways of dealing with inequitable behaviour that may arise during the sessions.</p>
									<p>It is the parent or carer’s responsibility to make the swimming school aware of any issues that may be a barrier to a child learning to swim. Any swimmers with medical conditions are made known to the Staff at the beginning of each term. The Staff will work together to devise a swimming programme that is achievable and challenging but which also reflects that swimmer’s abilities. Additional support either in or out of the water is provided when necessary and this is reviewed each term.</p>
									<p>Due to the design of the swimming pools, difficulty of access into the water may limit the lessons available to some physically disabled swimmers. All swimmers’ needs can be discussed on an individual basis and the Swimming School will endeavour to make swimming lessons available to all, providing safety requirements can be met.</p>
