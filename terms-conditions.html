										<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
									</header>

									
									
									
<p>All clients are expected to abide by the terms and conditions. In the unlikely event of failing to do so, a customer may be requested not to continue lessons with Waves Swim School. A refund will not be eligible in these circumstances. 
Clients are responsible for their children at all times before and after the actual lesson and must inform the teacher prior to the lesson of any concerns they have.</p>
<p>Clients must accept that at times there will be physical contact between the teacher and their child, in a professional, caring manner. Swimmers should not enter the pool until the teacher says it is safe to do so and must tell the teacher if leaving the pool before the end of the session. 
Clients should inform the teacher of any health issues that may be relevant. There is a strict nappy policy for those children not yet fully toilet trained and compulsory up to the age of 3. Nappies (including disposable swim nappies) must not be left on the pool premises.</p>
 
<h2>Credits & Refunds</h2>
<p>In the event a client is unable to attend a lesson due to sickness or holiday, Waves Swim School are unable to refund the client as the payment secures the place for the full term. In the case of serious illness (i.e a broken limb) each case will be considered individually, and in exceptional circumstances, the client may be given the option of carrying lessons over at a later date. Please note that once payment has been made for courses no refunds will be given.
Refunds will be offered, as a credit on next term’s fees,  in the case of circumstances outside the control of Waves Swim School such as pool closure by the operating organisation such as - adverse weather conditions, power  interruption, ‘act of god’ as deemed to be contractually outside of the swim school’s control.
 
<h2>Lesson Prices</h2>
<p>Waves Swim School terms mirror in length those of schools in the area.  When a class is booked, full payment is requested to secure the place for that term. Classes may be joined at ANY point in the term (and clients pay for the classes remaining). 
Discounts are given for families with 3 or more children taking lessons.</p>
<p>Fees are reviewed on an annual basis and increases take effect from September each year.</p>
 
 
<h2>Trial Lessons</h2>
<p>Trial Lessons are available, and if the swimmer then continues with lessons, the cost of the trial lesson will be included in the invoice.</p>
<h2>Clients’ Standards</h2>
<p>Clients should not run on the pool side, should remove loose fitting or sharp jewellery, tie back long hair or wear a swim cap, do not drink alcohol prior to the lesson and do not eat or chew gum during the lesson.
.Photography is not permitted at any time.</p>
<p>Clients must follow pool procedures as advised to them at the time of confirmation. Clients should aim to arrive no more than 15 minutes before the lesson and leave no more than 15 minutes after the lesson to help improve changing room comfort. 
Strictly no outdoor footwear or buggies are allowed either in the changing room or on poolside.</p>
 <h2>Welfare</h2>
<p>Lost property found at the pools will be either left at the main school reception or check with the swimming teacher.</p>
<p>Abuse to any member of staff either verbal or physical will not be tolerated and will be reported to the appropriate authorities at the sole discretion of Waves Swim School.</p>
<p>Clients must adhere to the instructions given to them regarding car parking, entry and exit route to pools. Waves Swim School cannot be held responsible for any consequential loss or damage to a client’s vehicle or property whilst in the pool’s grounds.</p>
 
<h2>Re-booking</h2>
<p>Clients will be emailed booking forms for the next term with badges achieved at the end of every term. Non-payment by the due date will attract an administration charge of £10. Please contact Anita if you have not received a booking form, and Liz with account queries.</p>
<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>Waves Swim School do not store or record any information about client’s bank accounts or credit cards. The Swim School maintain a database of pupils’ details, which are kept in line with the current data protection requirements, and Waves is registered with the ICO.</p>
 

<h2>Returned Cheques</h2>
<p>In the unlikely event of a client’s cheque being returned by the bank as unpaid, a £10 admin charge will be applied.</p>
 
<h2>Lesson Changes</h2>
<p>Waves will endeavour to ensure children are in appropriate groups for their swimming ability, and as such can be moved to another group, when deemed necessary.</p>
 
<h2>Pool Closures</h2>
<p>In the unlikely event of the ‘pool’ not being available for use due to technical difficulties or health and safety issues, Waves will endeavour to contact all parents/carers of the closure and arrange a credit off next term’s bill.</p>
 
<h2>Medical Conditions</h2>
<p>Clients must declare to Waves of any existing medical conditions that they are aware of that the child, or adult if taking lessons, which may be communicable or possibly be harmful or not to another person. The client must agree to inform the swim school of any changes in any medical condition or psychological condition as soon as they are aware of them. All information will be kept strictly confidential and it is at the swim school’s discretion to accept or refuse any applicant to join in classes.</p>
<h2>Illness</h2>
<p>Should the child or the adult swimmer develop, any known or suspected medical condition they must consult their doctor before taking them swimming and inform the swim school in writing via email or post. All information received is treated in confidence and with sensitivity. Clients must never bring the child swimming if they have any illness such as an ear infection, diarrhoea, chicken pox, impetigo, conjunctivitis or merely a bad cold. They must wait until the doctor has given the all-clear before returning to classes. In the instance of sickness and diarrhoea the child must have been clear of all symptoms for at least 48 hours before attending a lesson.</p>
 

<h2>Withdrawal of service</h2>
<p>The swim school, at its own discretion, may refuse entry to a client to its courses if it is felt that the client’s behaviour is in any way disruptive or unreasonable.</p>
