											<h1>Waves Swim School</h1>
											<h2>Quality swimming lessons in Bristol</h2>
										<p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> (founded 1998) provides swimming lessons to hundreds of children across Bristol, and has developed an excellent reputation for its high standard of teaching.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> have an experienced team of teachers, all holding ASA and RLSS qualifications, with full child protection and DBS coverage. We have a range of specialisms, to be able to teach swimmers and non-swimmers of all ages and abilities.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> strongly believes that children benefit from learning to swim in a fun, safe and structured way. Our ‘Beginner’ and ‘Learn-To-Swim’ lessons are small (taking a maximum of 4 children), with each child receiving the attention they need to develop core skills at their own pace, assisted by teachers in the water. Following the ‘Beginner’ and ‘Learn-To-Swim’ classes, they will learn more technical stroke work in all four strokes, and develop stamina and good form.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Waves Swim School</strong> can offer one-to-one lessons for adults and children on request. Swimmers are continually assessed, and progress at a rate suited to their ability.</p>
                                        <p>For full details of all the classes available, please see the <strong><a href="http://wavesswimschool.co.uk/timetables.html">Timetables</a></strong> page.</p>
